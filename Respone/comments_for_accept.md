Dear Reviewer,

Thank you for your thorough review and constructive feedbacks on our paper. We appreciate your positive remarks regarding the clarity of expression, novelty of the proposed approach and the performance of our experimental results.


1.&nbsp;**Comment:** The Fig.5 is too small.

**Response:** We would appreciate your comments on the size of Fig.5 and we will ensure that it is appropriately adjusted to improve readability for our readers.

2.&nbsp;**Comment:** More papers of SIGKDD need to be cited (missing references).

**Response:** Thank you for pointing this out. We understand the importance of citing more papers from SIGKDD and we accordingly further incorporated additional relevant references to strengthen the paper’s context and contribution. Our original manuscript already cited **seven papers** from SIGKDD, as follows:

According to your suggestion, we included additional **three more papers** from SIGKDD, as follows:

- Kyle Hundman, Valentino Constantinou, Christopher Laporte, Ian Colwell, and Tom Soderstrom. 2018. Detecting spacecraft anomalies using lstms and nonparametric dynamic thresholding. In Proceedings of the 24th ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining. 387–395.

We believe that these additional citations enrich the background of our manuscript and demonstrate its alignment with the relevant references in the field.

Sincerely,

All authors
